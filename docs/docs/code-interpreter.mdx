# Code Interpreter

The Code Interpreter in Flappy serves as an equivalent replacement for [ChatGPT Code Interpreter](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins#code-interpreter), enabling the language model to fulfill complex user requirements through Python code. What sets Flappy's Code Interpreter apart from other open-source implementations in the market is its sandboxed safety feature. This ensures that it meets the stringent security needs necessary for deployment in a production environment.

## How it works

Flappy's Code Interpreter is built with Rust, featuring a WebAssembly runtime environment that complies with the [WASIX specifications](https://wasix.org/docs/api-reference). Unlike standard WebAssembly runtimes, this environment hosts a Python interpreter and supports nearly all POSIX interfaces, including socket, net, and filesystem IO operations. This means that even though the Python interpreter operates within a wasm sandbox, all functionalities remain fully intact.

The current version of the Python interpreter used in this environment is `Python 3.12`. All standard libraries (stdlib) work as expected. We are also in the process of adding support for the pip package manager, which will allow for further extension of capabilities.

## Security-First Design

Our core design principle is "safety first". By default, access to the external network is off to ensure a secure environment. Similarly, environment variables are sandbox-isolated. However, if required, these settings can be overridden using custom configurations.

## Usage

  <TabItem value="nodejs" label="NodeJS (TypeScript)" default>

```ts
import { createFlappyAgent, ChatGPT, createCodeInterpreterFunction } from '@pleisto/node-flappy'
import OpenAI from 'openai'

const gpt35 = new ChatGPT(
  new OpenAI({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,
    baseURL: process.env.OPENAI_API_BASE!
  }),
  'gpt-3.5-turbo'
)

const agent = createFlappyAgent({
  llm: gpt35,
  functions: [createCodeInterpreterFunction({ name: 'pythonSandbox' }, { enableNetwork: false })]
})

void agent.executePlan(
  'There are some rabbits and chickens in a barn. What is the number of chickens if there are 396 legs  and 150 heads in the barn?'
)
```
